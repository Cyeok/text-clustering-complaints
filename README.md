# Text Clustering for Customer Complaints on Financial Products or Services
This project focus on Text Analysis and Clustering of complaint narratives that consumers sent to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Models tested were : 
- Kmeans
- Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM)

## Problem Statement
Complaints narratives can be a valuable source of information for Financial companies. However,due to the unstructured nature of the data, it is time consuming to manually examine vast amount of complaints narratives. Text analysis can help financial companies to find out :
- prime concerns of their customers (e.g. any large clusters of similar complaints?)
- prominent weakness in their processes that need to be addressed
- shift in customer needs over time

This project aims to explore the use of text analysis with various clustering techniques to cluster unstructured customer feedback. The clusters will then be further analyzed to identify the underlying customer needs and problem areas.

## Data Source
For the purpose of this study, Consumer Complaints Data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database) were used. This dataset has close to 2 million entries collected from year 2011 to 2017 from various Financial Institutions from various states in the United States of America.

## Methodology
The CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) is the methodology used for this project.
